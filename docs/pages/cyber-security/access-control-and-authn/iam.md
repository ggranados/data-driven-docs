IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. It is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that facilitate the management of digital identities and control access to resources within an organization's IT environment. *The primary goal of IAM is to ensure that the right individuals have the appropriate level of access to the right resources at the right time*.

IAM plays a critical role in ensuring data security, protecting sensitive information, and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. It is an essential part of modern IT infrastructure, especially in large organizations and enterprises where managing access control for a large number of users and resources can be complex.

## Key components of IAM

- **Identification**: The process of uniquely identifying users, devices, or services within the system. This involves assigning a unique digital identity to each entity.


- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or entities through various means such as passwords, biometrics, security tokens, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

    - See also: [AuthN](../../web-services-and-api-design/authentication-and-authorization/authn-authz.md#authentication-authn)


- **Authorization**: The process of granting appropriate access rights and permissions to authenticated users based on their roles, responsibilities, and the resources they need to access.

  - See also: [AuthZ](../../web-services-and-api-design/authentication-and-authorization/authn-authz.md#authorization-authz)


- **Access Control**: Enforcing policies that determine what resources (e.g., files, applications, databases) users are allowed to access and what actions they can perform on those resources.


- **User Provisioning and De-provisioning**: Managing the process of creating user accounts, granting access, and removing access when it is no longer needed (e.g., when an employee leaves the organization).


- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: A mechanism that allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications and services without having to log in again for each application.


- **Federation**: Enabling users to access resources in one domain (e.g., within an organization) using their credentials from another trusted domain (e.g., a partner organization).


- **Audit and Compliance**: Monitoring and recording user activities to ensure compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements.
