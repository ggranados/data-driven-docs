## Introduction to REST Architecture
### What is REST?

REST stands for "Representational State Transfer." It is an architectural style and set of constraints used in *designing and structuring networked applications*, particularly *web services and APIs*.

REST is commonly used to build distributed systems that allow different software components to communicate over a network, typically the internet.
