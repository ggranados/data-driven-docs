Concurrency inJava is managed primarily through the use of **threads** and the `java.util.concurrent package`, which provides a framework for working with concurrent code. 

Java's concurrency management has evolved over the years, here are some key aspects of how concurrency is managed in modern Java:

## Threads:

Java supports _multi-threading_, allowing you to create and manage multiple threads of execution within a single Java process.
You can create threads by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. 

>The Executor framework and thread pools provide more advanced ways to manage threads.

Java also introduced the `ForkJoinPool` for efficient parallelism in Java 7, which is useful for recursive tasks.

- See also: [Threads](concurrency/threads.md)

## Thread Safety:

Java provides synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks and methods, as well as the `volatile` keyword, to ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.
The `java.util.concurrent` package offers higher-level abstractions like `locks`, `semaphores`, and `barriers` to help manage thread synchronization more effectively.

## Executors

The `java.util.concurrent.Executors` class provides a factory for creating thread pools, which are useful for managing and reusing threads efficiently. _Executors abstract away the details of thread creation and management_.

>Executors can be used to submit tasks for execution and manage their lifecycles.

## Concurrency Utilities

The `java.util.concurrent` package includes various utilities for concurrent programming, such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, and `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, which are thread-safe data structures.


- See also: [Concurrent Collections]()<!-- TODO: -->


Other abstractions like `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, and `Semaphore` help manage synchronization between threads.

## Callable and Future

Java provides the `Callable` interface for defining tasks that can return values or throw exceptions. You can submit `Callable` tasks to executors and receive `Future` objects in return.

A `Future` represents a placeholder for the result of a computation, allowing you to retrieve the result asynchronously or cancel the task.

## CompletableFuture

Introduced in Java 8, `CompletableFuture` is a powerful and flexible API for asynchronous and concurrent programming. It allows you to compose asynchronous operations, handle exceptions, and more.

`CompletableFuture` supports callbacks, chaining of operations, and combining multiple asynchronous tasks.

## Java Memory Model:

Java's memory model defines how threads interact with memory, ensuring consistency and visibility of data among threads. This includes rules for volatile variables, synchronized blocks, and atomic operations.

## Parallel Streams:

Java 8 introduced parallel streams as a way to perform parallel processing on collections. You can leverage parallel streams to easily parallelize operations on collections without dealing with low-level threading details.


- See also: [Parallel Streams](stream-api.md#parallel-streams)

## Reactive Programming:

Libraries like **Reactor** and **RxJava** provide reactive programming capabilities in Java for handling asynchronous and event-driven programming.
