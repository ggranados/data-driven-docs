## What's Procedural Programming

Procedural programming organizes code into reusable procedures or functions that operate on data. It emphasizes the use of procedures to encapsulate behavior and separate it from data.

## Examples

The example is a C program that defines a function to calculate the sum of two numbers and prints the result.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = sum(3, 4);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

## Languages

The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957–1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC. Pascal and C were published circa 1970–1972.
