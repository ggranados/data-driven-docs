# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, [Java](../languages/java/java.md#whats-oop), and Python.[^1]
