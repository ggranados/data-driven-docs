## What's Imperative Programming

Imperative programming focuses on *explicitly specifying a sequence of statements* that modify program state. It emphasizes how to achieve a result through step-by-step instructions and control flow structures like loops and conditionals. 

Procedural programming and structured programming are subsets of imperative programming.

## Languages

[Procedural](procedural/procedural.md) and [object-oriented programming (OOP)](procedural/structured/object-oriented.md) languages fall under imperative programming, such as C, C++, C#, and [Java](../../languages/java).

## Examples

The example calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop in Java.

```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
```

> Declarative style is a contrast to the Imperative style
